# Virtual Pet Shelter

Shelter will contain up to 4 pets of user generation and will give the user options to Feed (all, single), Water (all, single), Play (all, single), Take to Doctor (single), Adopt (remove pet from shelter), Admit (add new pet to shelter), and Quit. All pets will have individualized stats that are affected by user actions. All pets will have a status description based on "invisible" buff/debuff stats.
